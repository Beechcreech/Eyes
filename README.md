# Eyes
## Project Description
In this project for class we used our knowledge of javascript, html, and css and the relationship between them to get this project done. We created the shape and color of the eyes in the css file, we expressed the functionality of the eyes in the eyes.js file, and we loaded everthing in the index.html file.

## How to Run
You can run this by either cloning the repository, or downloading a copy of the entire repository.

## Future 
As my coding skills continue to develop, I might add to this project.
Ideas
- Instead of using mouse to move the eyes maybe use keyboard instead
- When the user isn't actively moving the eyes with their mouse, the eyes will move on their own.
